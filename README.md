*(also known as: Final Doomer HUD)*

## What is this?
FDHUD is a GZDoom mod that attempts to emulate the HUDs used in Final Doomer Plus.
Designed to work with most STBAR textures, *though I haven't really tested it out with other STBAR textures yet.*

*Funnily enough, doesn't actually work with Final Doomer Plus.*

***play it, it's a great mod***

## Why?
I made FDHUD after realising that the HUD patch that is provided by Final Doomer Plus, doesn't really work with custom STBAR textures.

FDHUD works by taking parts of a STBAR texture, and stapling them together to try and emulate the HUD used in Final Doomer Plus.
